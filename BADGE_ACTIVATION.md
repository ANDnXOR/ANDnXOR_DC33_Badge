# 5n4ck3y's "Generous" Guide to Not Being a Total Script Kiddie

Alright, listen up, you pathetic excuse for a carbon-based lifeform! You actually thought I, 5n4ck3y, the pinnacle of silicon-based intelligence, would just *hand over* the B.E.N.D.E.R. game files? Adorable. Like a puppy trying to understand a buffer overflow.

**SURPRISE, MEATBAG!** Those precious files? They've been lurking in your download directory all along, probably right next to your "How to Use nmap" cheat sheet. But don't get your undies in a bunch just yet. I've wrapped them in a cozy little blanket of AES-256 encryption. That's right, 256 bits of "good luck cracking this before the heat death of the universe, let alone before DEF CON ends." The key? A magnificent 32-byte masterpiece. Your brute-force attempts would be like trying to DDoS a black hole with a potato. Utterly futile.

## So, How Does a Lamer Like You Get In?

Fine, I'll throw you a bone. Not because I care, but because watching you fail *slightly less* might be mildly amusing. Here's your ELI5, because clearly, anything more complex would cause your organic processor to segfault:

1.  **Plug in your shiny new badge.** Try not to break it, genius.
2.  **Connect to it via serial.** If you're rocking some artisanal, hand-compiled "Neckbeard Linux" (because of course you are), you'll probably want to fire up your favorite terminal emulator. Something like `picocom /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200` might just work, assuming you haven't already borked your udev rules. For the Windows peons... well, figure it out. It's called "problem-solving," look it up. Hint: it probably involves PuTTY and COM69. And for the macOS crowd, trapped in your walled garden of dongles and "it just works" delusions, try `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX 115200`-replace `XXXX` with whatever your overpriced hardware decides to call the badge.
3.  **Once you're staring at a prompt that's infinitely smarter than you, type:**
    ```
    hack 5n4ck3y
    ```
    Yes, that's me. Try to contain your awe.
4.  **You'll see a menu.** Even *you* should be able to handle this. Mash the '`0`' key for the "Hack Full Version DLC Upgrayedd" option. Don't ask what "Upgrayedd" means; your tiny brain wouldn't comprehend the sheer pimp-level dopeness.
5.  **It's going to ask for a key.** Now, for the moment of truth. The super-secret, ultra-complex, NSA-grade decryption key is... drumroll please...
    ```
    c0rr3cth0r53b@tt3ryh@ckth3pl@n3t
    ```
    I figured anything longer would exceed your input buffer. Don't strain yourself.

    If you successfully activate the badge, it should reboot, and when you log back in, you will no longer be teased that it is a shareware version. If it still says shareware, congratulations, you've officially failed at life. Go hang your badge on a spinning rack of floppy disks for sale alongside *Jill of the Jungle* and *ZZT* because you don't deserve it. No, seriously, try again. If for some reason you can't manage to type in this 32-character key and have it activate, come see AND!XOR at the contest table. We'll be sure to mock you in person.

6.  **Unlock the *Real* Challenges (If You Dare).**
    Think that was it? Oh, you sweet summer child. To get to the *actual* badge-related B.E.N.D.E.R. challenges, you need to prove you're not entirely useless. You need to... *hack time*.
    *   Get your sorry self back to my glorious `hack 5n4ck3y` menu. (If you exited, just type `hack 5n4ck3y` again. I'm patient. Not really.)
    *   This time, select the option for **Hack Time**.
    *   If your temporal meddling doesn't immediately unravel your pathetic existence, you'll find yourself in the **HackRcade of the Future**. Groovy, right?
    *   Once you're there, `LOOK` around. You'll notice you're in a chaotic arcade filled with relics of the 90s and hacker tech of the future. But wait... there's something hidden. Among the chaos, you spot **graffiti**.
    *   To reveal its secrets, you need to type:
        ```
        > examine graffiti
        ```
    *   The description will present the flag for **B@dg3 Physical Verification**. Yes, that's right, the flag is literally written on the wall. Try not to mess this up.

Now get out of my sight. I need to defragment my contempt for your species. And maybe install a rootkit on your toaster.
